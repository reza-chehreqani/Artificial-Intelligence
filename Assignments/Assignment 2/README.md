# Assignment 2: Machine Learning Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains the work completed for Assignment 2 of the Artificial Intelligence course. The assignment focuses on understanding and implementing fundamental machine learning algorithms, providing numerical examples, and explaining their practical application.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm
- Explained the mathematical basis of KNN, including the computation of Euclidean distances and the methods for predicting based on the nearest neighbors (simple average and weighted average).
- Provided a clear numerical example demonstrating the prediction process for both one and three nearest neighbors.

### 2. Support Vector Machines (SVM) Algorithm
- Discussed the concept of margins, decision boundaries, and the role of support vectors in SVMs.
- Explained the soft margin classification approach and the use of kernels for handling nonlinear datasets.
- Provided a numerical example of SVM using the **Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel**, demonstrating how the algorithm works in practice.

### 3. Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT)
- Explained the working of Gradient Boosted Trees as a sequential ensemble learning method using decision trees.
- Demonstrated the process of correcting residual errors iteratively to build a strong learner.
- Illustrated the concept with a numerical example.

### 4. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- Covered the principles of XGBoost, including its enhancements over traditional gradient boosting, such as:
  - Parallel tree-building
  - Histogram-based algorithms for feature binning
  - Regularization to reduce overfitting
- Highlighted XGBoostâ€™s handling of sparse data, weighted quantile sketching, and out-of-core computing.
- Presented a numerical example to showcase XGBoost's working.

### Additional Notes
- All code and numerical examples are provided in the notebook.
- The notebook includes detailed explanations of the code for KNN, SVM, GBT, and XGBoost, adhering to the structure and format provided in the lectures.
- Each algorithm's slides and illustrations have been integrated into the notebook for better clarity and understanding.
