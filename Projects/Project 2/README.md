# Project 2: Clustering, DecisionTree, and Quantum Neural Networks

## Overview
This repository contains the completed work for Project 2 of the Artificial Intelligence course. The project covers topics in unsupervised and supervised learning, as well as an introduction to quantum computing and quantum neural networks. 

## Completed Tasks

### Part I: Unsupervised Learning
- **Mathematical Intuition:** Explained the mathematical concepts behind:
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**
  - **Density-Based Spatial Clustering (DBSCAN)**  
  Included clear examples for each algorithm to demonstrate their mechanisms.
  
- **Clustering Models:** Built and compared three unsupervised models using the provided dataset:
  - **K-Means Clustering**
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**
  - **DBSCAN**
  - Clustered investors based on factors such as age, income, risk tolerance, and other financial metrics to aid portfolio management. Compared the performance of the models in grouping data effectively.

### Part II: Supervised Learning
- **Gini Impurity and Entropy:**
  - Explained the mathematical intuition behind the Gini Impurity Index with an example.
  - Compared decision tree splits using Gini Impurity and Entropy to highlight their effect on tree balance.
  
- **Decision Tree and Random Forest Models:**
  - Trained Decision Tree and Random Forest models using the dataset from Assignment 1.
  - Computed and analyzed the classification reports for both models.
  
- **Regression with Decision Trees:**
  - Implemented Decision Tree and Random Forest regression models on the Boston housing dataset to predict housing prices.

### Part III: Quantum Computing and Quantum Neural Networks
- **Quantum Data Encoding:**  
  - Explained Basis Encoding and Amplitude Encoding with examples.
  - Demonstrated these encoding methods using Qiskit (IBM).
  
- **Quantum Circuits:**  
  - Explained and implemented a quantum circuit provided in the project instructions using Qiskit.

- **Quantum Neural Networks (QNN):**
  - Reviewed and elucidated each block of code from the QNN notebook provided during the lecture.
