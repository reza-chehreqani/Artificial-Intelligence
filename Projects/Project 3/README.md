# Project 3: Reinforcement Learning, LSTM, and Search

## Overview
This repository contains the completed work for Project 3 of the Artificial Intelligence course. The project covers Reinforcement Learning, advanced neural networks (LSTM), and search algorithms, with practical implementations and detailed explanations.

## Completed Tasks

### Part I: Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning
- **Policy Iteration:**  
  - Provided a detailed explanation of Policy Iteration with an example, illustrating all the steps from random policy initialization to convergence.
  
- **Deep Q Learning:**  
  - Explained the given Deep Q Learning code line by line.
  - Performed hyperparameter optimization to improve the model's performance on the Cartpole game.

- **FrozenLake Game with Neural Network-Based Q-Learning:**  
  - Implemented a neural network-based Q-learning system to train an agent to navigate safely from the start (S) to the goal (G) in the FrozenLake game.
  - Explained the problem, neural network architecture, and results in detail.

### Part II: RNN and LSTM
- **Mathematical Intuition Behind LSTM:**
  - Explained the need for LSTMs as an improvement over traditional RNNs.
  - Detailed the forget, input, and output gates of LSTMs using a comprehensive example.
  - Walked through the steps of backpropagation in LSTMs for the same example.

- **RNN, GRU, and LSTM Models:**  
  - Analyzed and explained the provided RNN-GRU-LSTM notebook line by line.
  - Improved the model’s performance:
    - Increased the R² score in Part I.
    - Reduced RMSE for train and test data in Part II.

### Part III: Search Algorithms
- **Informed Search (A\*):**  
  - Provided two manual examples and implemented Python scripts for solving problems using the A\* search algorithm.

- **Min-Max Search:**  
  - Explained the tree traversal sequence for Min-Max search with two manual examples.
  - Developed Python scripts to demonstrate the process.

- **Uninformed Search (DFS, BFS, UCS):**  
  - Created Python scripts for Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), and Uniform Cost Search (UCS) using example problems.

- **Constraint Satisfaction Problem:**  
  - Solved a map-coloring problem (four-color theorem) using Python.
  - Implemented and explained the approach using a constraint satisfaction framework.
